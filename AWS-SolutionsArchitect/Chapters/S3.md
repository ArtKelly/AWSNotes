## Overview of S3
- Simple Storage Sevice
- Object storage in the cloud
- You get unlimited storage
- Max object size is 5Tb
- Each S3 bucket name has to be globally unique
- https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name
- When uploading, returns http 200 on success
	- Key: name of the object
	- Version ID: important for multiple versions of object
	- Value: the data itself
	- Metadata: Data about the object stored
- Built for availability - 99.95% -> 99.99% service availability depending on tier
- Designed for durability 99.999999999% durability


### Standard S3
- default s3 storage class
- High availability and durability (Devices across multiple facilities >=3 AZs)
- Perfect for frequently accessed data
- Suitable for most workloads
	- Use cases: Websites, content distribution, Mobile and gaming applications, big data analytics

### Security
- Server-side encryption
- Access control lists
	- Defines which aws accounts are granted access and the type of access
	- Work on individual object level
- Bucket policies
	- Like IAM policies but for buckets

## Block Public Access
- By default all bucket access is blocked
- Cannot unblock objects unless bucket policy allows public objects

## Hosting Static S3 site
- HTML Websites
- Cannot host database connected sites
- S3 scales automatically
- Apply bucket policy to enable public access

## Versioning Objects
- Previous versions are not public (even with bucket policy in place)
- Deleting object creates a new 0b file with a Delete Marker. This becomes the new latest version of the file and is hidden by default. Files can be restored by deleting the marker.
- All versions are stored in S3
- Great backup tool
- You cannot delete versioning
- Lifecycle rules
- Supports MFA

## Storage Classes
- S3 Standard
	- High availability and Durability
	- Designed for frequent access
- S3 Standard-Infrequent-Access
	- Used for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed
	- Low per GB storage price, and a per-GB retrieval fee
	- Great for long-term storage, backups, and disaster recovery files
- S3 One Zone Standard IA
	- Single Availability Zone
	- Costs 20%
	- Great for long-lived, infrequently accessed, non-critical data
	- 99.5% availability
- Glacier
	- Very infrequently accessed
	- Pay per access
	- Archiving
	- Retrieval times from 1m to 12 hours
- Glacier Deep Archive
	- Archiving rarely accessed data. 
	- retrieval time of 12 hours or more
	- Cheapest archive option
- Intelligent tiering
	- Uses ML to move you're storage class to the most suitable tier depending on how you use your bucket

## Lifecycle management
- Moves objects between storage tiers to save money
- Moves different versions of objects to different tiers
- Lifecycle rules can be created to define how to transition objects and which object to move.

## Object Lock and Glacier Vault Lock
- You can use S3 Object lock using a Write once, read many model.
	- prevents objects being modified or deleted
- Governance mode
	- Uses cant overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions
- Compliance mode
	- Protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user.
		- even by the root user
	- Ensures object cant be overwritten or deleted
- Retention Period
	- Protects an object version for a fixed amount of time
	- After the retention period expires, the object version can be overwritten or deleted. 
- Legal Holds
	- Prevents an object version from being overwritten or Deleted
	- Legal holds can be freely placed and removed by any user who has s3:PutObjectLegalHold Permission
- Glacier Vault Lock
	- Easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier vaults with a vault lock policy
- Write Once, Read Many (WORM)

## Encrypting S3 Objects
- Types of Encryption
	- Encryption in Transit
		- Using SSL certificates
		- HTTPS
	- Encryption at rest
		- Server-side Encryption
		- SSE-S3: S3-managed keys, using AES 256-bit encryption
		- SSE-KMS: AWS Key management Service
		- SS3-C: Customer provided Keys
	- Encryption at rest
		- Client side encryption
		- You encrypt your files before uploading to S3
- Enforce Server-side Encryption
	- Can be set via console or through bucket policy
	- x-amz-server-side-encryption
		- If the file is encrypted at upload time, the parameter will be included in the request header
	- x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256
		- SSE-S3 S3-Managed keys
	- x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms
		- SSE-KMS - KMS managed keys
	- PUT Request Header
		- When the parameter is included in the header of the PUT request, it tells S3 to encrypt the object at the time of upload, using the specified encryption method
	- You can create a bucket policy to block requests without specifying encryption in the header

## Optimising S3 Performance
- S3 Prefixes
	- Bucket name -> sub folders
	- just the folders, doesn't include filenames
- S3 performance
	- Extremely low latency
	- The more prefixes you have, the better the performance
	- 5,500 requests/s per prefix
- S3 Limitations
	- KMS you must consider KMS limits
	- Uploading/Downloading will count toward the KMS quota
	- Currently you cannot request a quota increase for KMS
	- Region-specific, however, it's either 5,500, 10,000 or 30,000 requests/s
- Multipart uploads
	- Recommended for files over 100 Mb,
	- Required for files over 5GB
	- Parallelise uploads (Increase efficiency)
- S3 Byte-Ranges
	- S3 Byte-Range Fetches
		- Parallelise downloads by specifying byte ranges
		- if theres a failure in the download its only for a range
		- download partial amounts of file i.e. only header

## Backing up data using S3 replication
- You can replicate objects from one bucket to another
	- Versioning must be enabled
- Objects in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically
- Delete markers are not replicated by default
