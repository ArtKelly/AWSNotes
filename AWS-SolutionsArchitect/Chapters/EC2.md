# EC2
## Fundamental service of AWS
- Secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud
- Pay for what you use
- No wasted capacity
	- Grow and shrink capacity
- Provision in minutes not months

### Pricing
- On demand
- Reserved
	- Most cost efficient
- Spot
	- Price fluctuates with demand
- Dedicated
	- More expensive

####  On demand
- Low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2
- Short term, spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
- Testing the water. Applications being developed or tested

#### Reserved instances
- Predictable usage
- Specific capacity requirements
- Pay up front
- Standard RIs
	- Up to 72% off the on-demand price
- Convertible RIs
	- Up to 54% off the on-demand price
		- Has the option to change to a different RI of equal or greater value
- Scheduled RIs
	- Launch within the time window you define
	- Match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, week or month

#### Spot 
- Specify price to have spot instance.
	- Flexible start and end times
- Good for cost sensitive applications
- Users with an urgent need for additional computing capacity
- Image rendering
- Genomic sequencing
- Algorithmic trading engine

#### Dedicated Hosts
- Compliance
	- Regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualisation
- On-demand
	- Can be purchased on demand (hourly)
- Licensing
	- Great for licensing that does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
- Reserved
	- Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price

### CLI
- interact with aws using the command line
- User groups for security

### Using Roles
- Preferred from a security perspective
- Avoid hard coding credentials
- Policies control a roles permissions
- You can update a policy and it will take immediate effect
- You can attach and detach roles to running ec2 instances 

### Security groups and bootstrap scripts
- Virtual firewalls for your EC2 instance. 
	- by default all inbound traffic is blocked
- To let everything in: 0.0.0.0/0
- Bootstrap script runs when the instance first runs
- You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
- You can have multiple security groups attached to an EC2
- By default all outbound traffic is allowed

### Networking
- ENI (Elastic Network interface)
	- Simply a virtual network card
	- private ipv4, public ipv4, many ivp6. Mac address, 1 or more security groups
	- Uses:
		- Create a management network
		- Use network and security appliances in your vpc
		- Create dual-homed instances with workloads / roles on distinct subnets
		- create a low budget, high availability solution
- EN (Enhanced networking)
	- For High performance Networking between 10Gb/s - 100Gb/s
	- Single root I/O virtualisation
	- higher bandwidth, lower latency
	- ENA (Elastic network adapter) - 100Gb/s
	- INTEL82599 VFI - 10Gb/s, for older instances
- EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter)
	- A network device you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate high performance computing and machine learning applications.
	- Provides lower and more consistant latency and higher throughput than the TCP transport traditionally used in cloud-based systems
	- Faster + Lower latency
	- OS bypass

### Optimising EC2 with Placement groups
- Cluster
	- Grouping of instances within a single availability zone. recommended for applications that need low network latency, high network throughput, or both
- Spread
	- A group of instances that are placed on distinct underlying hardware
	- For applications  that have a small number o f critical instances that should be kept separate from each other.
- Partition
	- Each partition group has its own set of racks. Each rack has its own network and power source. 
- A cluster placement group can't span multiple availability zones, whereas, a spread placement group and partition placement group can.
- Only certain types of instances can be launched in a placement group (Compute optimised, GPU, Memory optimised, storage optimised)
- AWS recommends homogenous instances within cluster placement groups
- You can't merge placement groups
- You can move an existing instance into a placement group. Before you move the instance, the instance must be in the stopped state. You can move or remove an instance using the AWS Cli or an AWS SDK, but you can't do it via the console yet.

### Solving licensing issues with dedicated hosts
- Any question about special licensing requirements will require a dedicated host.
- Dedicated hosts allow you to use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses.

### Timing workloads with spot instances and spot fleets
- Spot block to stop your spot instances from being terminated even if the spot price goes over your max price.
- A spot fleet is a collection of spot instances and on-demand instances(optional)
- Try and match the target capacity with price restraints
- Define EC2 instance types
- You can have multiple pools, and the fleet will choose the best way
- capacity optimised, lowest price, diversified, instancePoolsToUseCount
